# Get-SCOMManagementPacks
In short the script grabs the names and the links for all management packs on the site. Than it goes trough every MP link. From every MP page gets the version of it and all download links (msi, guides and etc.). Than creates a directory for that MP and subdirectory with the version number and downloads all files in it.
